<p>We will take all reasonable precautions necessary to protect your personal data from</p>



<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loss, theft, misuse and interference;</p>



<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unauthorised access, disclosure, use or modification.</p>



<p>Such measures will vary depending on the sensitivity, amount, format, nature and storage of the information and will involve, as applicable, physical, organizational and electronic security measures.</p>



<p>This includes, for example, the protection of passwords using industry standard encryption, measures to preserve system security and prevent unauthorised access and back-up systems to prevent accidental or malicious loss of data. We may use third party data storage providers to store personal data electronically. We take reasonable steps to ensure this information is held as securely as information stored on our own equipment.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, there is always risk involved in sending information through any channel over the internet. You send information over the internet entirely at your own risk. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted over the internet and we do not warrant the security of any information, including personal data, which you transmit to us over the internet.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">6.International transfers of data</h3>



<p>The data that we collect from you will be transferred to, and stored at, destinations both within and outside the EEA. As mentioned above, we may disclose your personal data to our group companies and their service providers located in US and elsewhere, and to employees operating outside of the EEA who work for us or for one of our group companies or their respective service providers.</p>



<p>We want to make sure that your personal data is stored and transferred in a way which is secure. We will therefore only transfer data outside of the EEA where it is compliant with data protection legislation and the means of transfer provides adequate safeguards in relation to your data. For example, this could be:</p>



<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by way of an intra-group agreement between KeMing Studio entities, incorporating the current standard contractual clauses adopted by the European Commission for the transfer of personal data by controllers in the EEA to controllers and processors in jurisdictions without adequate data protection laws;</p>



<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by way of a data transfer agreement with a third party, incorporating the current standard contractual clauses adopted by the European Commission for the transfer of personal data by controllers in the EEA to controllers and processors in jurisdictions without adequate data protection laws; or</p>



<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by transferring your data to an entity which has signed up to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework for the transfer of personal data from entities in the EU to entities in the United States of America or any equivalent agreement in respect of other jurisdictions; or</p>



<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by transferring your data to a country where there has been a finding of adequacy by the European Commission in respect of that country’s levels of data protection via its legislation; or</p>



<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where it is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract between ourselves and a third party and the transfer is in your interests for the purposes of that contract (for example, if we need to transfer your data to a benefits provider based outside the EEA); or</p>



<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where you have consented to the data transfer.</p>



<p>Where we transfer your personal data outside the EEA and where the country or territory in question does not maintain adequate data protection standards, we will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">7.How long will we keep your personal data?</h3>



<p>We will not keep your personal data for longer than is necessary for the purposes for which we have collected it, unless we believe that the law or other regulation requires us to keep it (for example, because of a request by a tax authority or in connection with any anticipated litigation) or if we require it to enforce our agreements.</p>



<p>In general, we will retain your personal data for as long as we provide services to you and your account is active and following that period, for as long as we provide you directly with any other service offering.</p>



<p>When it is no longer necessary to retain your personal data, we will delete the personal data that we hold about you from our systems. While we will endeavour to permanently erase your personal data once it reaches the end of its retention period, some of your personal data may still exist within our systems, for example if it is waiting to be overwritten. For our purposes, this data has been put beyond use, meaning that, while it still exists in the electronic ether, our employees will not have any access to it or use it again.</p>

<p>Please note that you may only make a CCPA-related data access or data portability disclosure request twice within a 12-month period.</p>



<p>If you choose to contact us directly by email, you will need to provide us with:</p>



<p>· Enough information to identify you [(e.g., your full name, address and customer or matter reference number)];</p>



<p>· Proof of your identity and address (e.g., a copy of your driving license or passport and a recent utility or credit card bill); and</p>



<p>· A description of what right you want to exercise and the information to which your request relates.</p>

<p>Any personal information we collect from you to verify your identity in connection with you request will be used solely for the purposes of verification.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">12.Do Not Sell My Personal Information</h3>



<p>If you wish to opt out of the use of your personal information for interest-based advertising purposes and these potential sales as defined under CCPA law, you may do so by following the instructions below.</p>



<p>Please note that any opt-out is specific to the browser you use. You may need to opt out on every browser that you use.</p>



<p><strong>Mobile devices</strong></p>



<p>Please refer to your operating system settings, or follow instructions below:</p>



<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Android Users (version 2.3 and above)</p>



<p>To use the “opt-out of interest-based advertising” option, follow the instructions provided by Google here:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/3405269">Google Play Help.</a></p>




<p>Please note that these are device settings and will disable interest-based ads from all providers, and not just for us. We have decided to offer this way of opting-out, as we estimate users will either want to receive interest-based advertising or no interest-based advertising at all. The above described way is the most efficient way to achieve that goal. While we do provide the possibility to opt-out of remerge processing only, that would only mean that someone else but us would deliver the exact same advertisements.</p>



<p><strong>Website</strong></p>



<p>You can opt out of receiving ads that are personalized as served by our Service Providers by following our instructions presented on the Service:</p>



<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From our “Cookie Consent” notice banner</p>



<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or contact us at: jiklferwasry@gmail.com.</p>



<p>The opt out will place a cookie on your computer that is unique to the browser you use to opt out. If you change browsers or delete the cookies saved by your browser, you will need to opt out again.</p>
